1.Instructions for how to compile and run the software

This program is a recipe app that allows a user to enter the details of a recipe and perform some actions on it such as scaling, resetting, and clearing. 
The program defines three classes: Ingredient, Step, and Recipe. 
Ingredient represents an ingredient in a recipe.
Step represents a step in a recipe, and Recipe is the main class that contains an array of Ingredient objects and an array of Step objects. 
The Recipe class has several methods, including Display, which prints the recipe to the console with different colors for the different parts of the recipe.
Scale, which multiplies the quantity of each ingredient by a scaling factor specified as an argument.
Reset, which divides the quantity of each ingredient by a reset factor specified as an argument.
And Clear, which empties the Ingredients and Steps arrays, effectively clearing the recipe.
The program starts by displaying a welcome message and creating a new Recipe object.
Then it enters a while loop which displays a menu of options for the user to choose from. 
The user can enter the details of the ingredients and steps, display the recipe, scale the recipe, reset the recipe, clear the recipe, or exit the program. 
The program uses Console.ReadLine to get input from the user and Console.WriteLine to display output to the user.
